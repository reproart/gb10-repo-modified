# Build manifest

Resolved build configuration for every number in
[`RESULTS.md`](RESULTS.md). Recorded 2026-08-24 from the machine that produced
them.

Tags and default branches move; digests and commits do not. If your numbers
differ from ours, compare this table first — a mismatch here explains more than
any amount of re-benchmarking.

## Which inputs are pinned, and which are not

Pinned by the scripts in this repo: target revision, draft revision, toolkit
commit.

Pinned by the toolkit itself: the SGLang commit and the NVFP4 head patch.

**Not pinned:** the base image is referenced by tag, not digest, by the
toolkit's build script. The digest above is what that tag resolved to on the
build date. If `lmsysorg/sglang:qwen38-27b` is republished, a rebuild produces a
different image than the one benchmarked here, and nothing in the build will
warn you.

Regenerate this table with [`scripts/build-manifest.sh`](../scripts/build-manifest.sh).

## Image note

These numbers were produced with the **locally built** `qwen38-27b-dflash2`,
before LMSYS published official DFlash2 images on 2026-08-22. New installs pull
`dev-cu13-qwen38-27b-dflash2` instead and need no `lm_head` patch; the local
build is still reachable with `BUILD_LOCAL=1`.

The two have not been benchmarked head to head here. An
[independent run](REPRODUCTION.md) used the official image and landed within ~1%
on every headline figure, which is evidence they are equivalent but not proof.
